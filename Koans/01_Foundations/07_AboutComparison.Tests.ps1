    Comparison Operators

    Comparison operators are often used to compare two values. If the values
    satisfy the condition set by the operator, the expression returns $true;
    otherwise, it returns $false.

    Mathematical comparison operators are two letters preceded by a hyphen:
    -eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -le, -ge

    It's important to remember that when working with arrays, this behaviour
    changes completely, as you will see shortly, and they instead return
    all items in the array that match the condition, or $null if no items
    satisfy the condition.
